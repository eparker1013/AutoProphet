## Installation
To begin contributing to the repository:

1. Clone the repository using git into a folder on your computer where you want to store the code locally
   1. Windows users can install Git for Windows. After installing, you will clone the repository using GitBash.
      1. Within GitBash, use the cd (change directory) and ls (list) commands to select the directory where you will clone the files.
      2. After selecting the directory with the cd command, run: git clone https://github.com/jeffreywallphd/AutoProphet.git
      3. Check the directory to make sure that it now has the files from the GitHub repository
   2. Many IDE's also have this capability to clone repositories if you don't like using command line tools. Follow a similar process. 
2. Install nodeJS by visiting: https://nodejs.org/en/download
   1. By default it should install npm, which is a package manager for NodeJS. You will need npm installed.
3. Install the nodeJS packages that the the application uses. In the command prompt on Windows or the terminal on Mac/Linux:
   1. Make sure you are in the directory where you cloned the repository using the cd and ls commands. You will want to select the directory within the project where the package.json file is located. Currently, this is in the auto-prophet folder within the root folder.
   2. Once you have selected the directory, to install the NodeJS packages used for the project, run the command: npm install
4. Now you need to configure the application. Configuration is currently limited.
   1. Create a folder named config in the folder containing the package.json file (this is currently the auto-prophet folder).
   2. Within the config folder, create a file named default.json
   3. Paste the following into the default.json file: { "StockGateway": "AlphaVantageStockGateway" }
5. TO UTILIZE PRICE/VOLUME FEATURES: Store an API key in a .env file.
   1. If you do not have one already, get a free Alpha Vantage API key from https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key.
   2. Create a file called ".env" in the auto-prophet folder.
   3. In that .env file, create a JSON object in the following form:
        {
            "ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY": "your key here"
        }
   4. Save your .env file and now you can use price/volume features that pull data from the Alpha Vantage API.
6. After installing the npm packages, adding the config folder and file, and creating the .env file, you are ready to run the application. Type the following command to launch the Electron application: npm start
   1. After the startup finishes, you should see the desktop interface for the application 

## Collaboration Practices
Please be sure to read through the [Best Coding Practices](BestCodingPractices.md) document before you start collaborating.

As you use git and GitHub to manager your contributions, follow the guidelines outlined in the [Git Practices](GitPractices.md) document. Remember to pull from main regularly to avoid code conflicts.
